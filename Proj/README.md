### Description

This project was developed by _Pedro Vieira_(up202206230@fe.up.pt), _Pedro Marinho_(up202206854@fe.up.pt) and _Sergio Nossa_(up202206856@fe.up.pt).

The purpose of this project is to understand how to model and structure the data for a topic. We chose to make a spotify like database to store the info about the users, artists, podcasters and etc...

To show the correctness of the database we used sqlite3 to populate and create the database.
